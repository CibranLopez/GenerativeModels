Project: Generative library

Cibran: Convert graph into POSCAR (not working properly right now).

Cibran: Check other approaches for edge attribute prediction.

Cibran: When introducing graph-level embeddings, explore convoluting node and graph-level separately and then convolving those latent representations together. Explore how these approaches have been implemented before in AI.

Cibran: Edge losses converge to 1 very quickly, test standardizations with bigger scales.

Cibran: GPU enabled, check that everything it begin predicted and assigned correctly.
