Project: Generative library

Cibran: Check other approaches for edge attribute prediction.

Cibran: When introducing graph-level embeddings, explore convoluting node and graph-level separately and then convolving those latent representations together. Explore how these approaches have been implemented before in AI.

Cibran: Check conditional generation approaches (ILVR has been discussed in the draft).

Jacobo: Check schedule of weights in model backpropagations.
