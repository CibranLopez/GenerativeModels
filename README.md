# Equivariant Diffusion Models for Crystal Material Generation

This project introduces a novel framework for generating new crystal materials using equivariant diffusion models. The framework offers a powerful approach to surpass the limitations of existing databases by maximizing arbitrary targets such as conductivity, absorption, and more. The generated crystals demonstrate remarkable thermodynamic stability, compared against the Materials Project database, utilizing the convex-hull approach. 

The core technology behind this framework is based on a graph-like representation of data, where the diffusion process is achieved through the use of Markov chains. The denoising aspect of the model is implemented using convolutional graph neural networks, ensuring high-quality results.
